**Hello world ðŸ‘‹**

- Iâ€™m currently learning ... JavaScript

```javascript
function keepLearning(javascript, css, html) {
  var getJob = javascript && css && html;
  if (getJob) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false;
 }   
```

- I contribute to open source, It is a great way to learn and work with a team. I also write for the [embertimes ðŸ“°](https://blog.emberjs.com/tags/newsletter.html) when I can.
