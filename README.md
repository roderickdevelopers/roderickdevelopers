**Hello world 👋**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... JavaScript

```javascript
function keepLearning(javascript, css, html) {
  var getJob = javascript && css && html;
  if (getJob) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false;
 }   
```

- I contribute to open source and I also write for the ember times 📰 when I can.
